          </h3>

          <p>
            I love McDonough and Braugart's discussion about effectiveness over efficiency. Efficiency is about being less bad (efficient cars and air conditioners, for example). Effectiveness is about being good. They give the example of a cherry tree, which is not efficient, because it produces so many flowers and fruit that never turn into new trees. But it is effective: it provides shade, habitat, food, and beauty. It exists in harmony with a bigger system. For me, effectiveness is about finding synergies and win-win situations, embracing complexity and diversity, and focusing on the positive stuff.

            When I read this book, I bookmarked almost every page. It offers insight into the complexities faced by professionals working in community development, alongside practical methods for analysing sites, engaging with communities and co-learning.

            It's a while since I read this one, but one interest it sparked in me is the idea of work and usefulness being integral to beauty.

          <p>
            A series of stories from zoologist and climate change scientist Tim Flannery, about his fieldwork in Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya. I love the sense of adventure and curiosity. He talks about the professional challenges, moral questions, and communication difficulties working in this mountainous and remote part of the world at the time that is was being opened up to Western influence.
