            <h1>Biography</h1>

            <p class="lead">
              Kate is an architect specialising in participatory design process for community development.
            </p>

          <h3>Professional</h3>

          <p>
            Kate has worked on projects in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, India, Turkey, and the Netherlands. Taking a community development approach, she is interested in how design and infrastructure projects can be avenues for learning, empowerment and community strengthening. Kate's project experience includes project planning and management, community engagement, participatory design, architectural documentation and report writing, facilitating community construction workshops and monitoring and evaluating the project's intended outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kate has developed, delivered and evaluated training workshops for professionals and volunteers to prepare them for community projects. She has also taught in university architecture schools for six years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kate has been an active volunteer during her education and professional life, and this has led to leadership and management experience across a number of community organisations and professional associations, including as a co-founder of CoDesign Studio.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2013/14 Kate authored a Participatory Design Handbook. Based on experience in Cambodia, the Handbook is a plain English guide for NGOs, designers and students, to assist them in the development and implementation of community based projects.

          <h3>Personal</h3>

          <p>
            I feel incredibly lucky to have grown up surrounded by a supportive family in the safe, stable and wealthy country of Australia. I'm thankful for the good teachers and many opportunities that have come my way.
          </p>

          <p>
            My family instilled in me a love of adventure, the outdoors and Australian landscapes through family camping trips. Living for three months in a camper trailer also teaches you cooperation and patience! I still spend a lot of my holidays outdoors. For me it is a time for quietness, letting my thoughts wander or disappear. And also a time for delicious, slightly-burned food and being with friends.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a teenager I went on a sail training tall ship for ten days. Toward the end, each team had to elect a captain who would lead the team when it was our turn on watch. Our team chose me. I was the only female chosen, and I could see surprise on a few faces Ð I think some people had not noticed my existence until then. I believe good leadership is about integrity, competence, facilitation and seeking to understand those around you. I strive for these things in everyday life as well as in leadership.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a high school exchange student I enjoyed learning a new language and finding my place in a different family. I learned to adapt to a new group dynamic and communication style, and this helped me realise how important it is to reflect on your own identity. We all make assumptions that have come from our upbringing and culture. I feel that the more we're aware of these, the more effectively we can live and work together.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Papua New Guinea, I lived with a group of other students in huts in the jungle while we built a health centre. One thing that surprised me was how quickly we adapted to a completely different lifestyle without electricity, phones, running water or personal privacy. I'm not saying life in a village is easy, it's not, and life expectancy in this area is low. But I know that I am capable of adapting to change, and this helps me live with less fear.
