            The Oasis Game methodology, developed by Elos Institute in Brazil, was used to mobilize a Rotterdam suburb for a revitalization project. It proves that change is possible, and that communities already have the things they need to improve their neighbourhood.
          </p>

          <p>
            A group of residents and volunteers looked around them for beauty in the neighbourhood, and went in search of the people behind the beauty, discovering many community talents along the way. As momentum built, public spaces were identified, designs were developed, materials collected, and within two days the site was transformed into a small park.
          </p>

          <p>
            The historic neighbourhood houses a mix of elderly long-time residents, immigrants, students, squatters, and middle class people moving into newly constructed apartment towers. The park will last between a few months and a few years, but new community relationships can strengthen over time and will enable residents to work together into the future.
