          <p>
            Consultation for the Richmond Renewal Project found that upgrading the ground floor foyers of the residential towers could help lift the appearance of the estate. The Makeover project took a low-cost, high-impact approach intended to last 1-3 years while funding for extensive upgrades is sought.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pop-up workshops in the foyers generated resident interest in the project and gathered ideas. Highly individual designs were developed in response to specific needs in each foyer, and were constructed by volunteers and residents during working bees. Simple installations such as information boards have increased the functionality of the foyers. Painted furniture, murals, woven ceiling panels, and astroturf have created a sense of individual identity.

            Residents appreciated the fast results and their feedback was very positive.
