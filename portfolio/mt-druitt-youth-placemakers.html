            During the school holidays a group of teenagers from Mt Druitt and architecture students from the University of Technology Sydney worked together to design and trial new ideas for the Mt Druitt Town Square. After analysing the site through photography and discussion, we mapped lots of ideas for the space, and chose to focus on making two seating areas and a pavement mural game. We built experiments, ran guided tours, gathered community feedback, and the ideas and experiments will inform a council-funded permanent upgrade of the space over the next two years.

            The program provided a forum for young people to learn new skills, make a contribution to their community, and participate in shaping an important public space in their neighbourhood. After a 4-week testing period the seating projects were relocated to the Emerton Youth Recreation Centre. The mural remains as permanent asset and reminder of the young people’s contribution.
            The Bidwill Chill Space was designed and built with young people from the Youth Activities Program run by Mt Druitt Learning Ground. Over nine sessions on Friday evenings we analysed the site, came up with ideas, developed them, voted on the best ones, and built it. The project takes a low-cost approach to testing ideas, and is intended to inform permanent upgrades in the future. It aimed to strengthen a sense of ownership, pride and identity in the reserve, and provide a forum for young people to learn new skills and make a contribution to their community.
