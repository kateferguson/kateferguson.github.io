            The suburb of Karawara in Perth has a diverse mix of public housing tenants, transient university students, long-term residents, young families and the elderly. Our engagement strategy included a stenciled discussion trail to promote the project, drop-in community barbeques around the suburb which involved mapping and design activities, and a series of formal workshops.
          </p>

          <p>
            This strategy reached a range of people including young people, children, the elderly and people from a range of cultural backgrounds. Feedback from participants was positive with 92% of participants thinking the activities were good and 83% believing they made a meaningful contribution to the project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Engagement led to a Public Open Space Masterplan and Community Action Plan. These documents break the masterplan down into a series of projects with varying priorities, stakeholders, budget requirements and timeframes. This approach encourages collaboration and shared responsibility between the local government, residents and other stakeholders.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the most immediate projects is a community herb garden, constructed by residents and maintained by the adjacent childcare centre. This low-cost, immediate action helps keep up momentum following the community engagement, ensure some results are achieved quickly, and encourage participation in longer term projects.
